Dynamic System Simulator - A CoCoVila package that enables to simulate a Dynamic system.
</p>
<p>
This package consists of a Simulation engine, a clock, an adder, an inverter, an integrator, a multiplier, a cosine and a graph drawing block.

<p>
The package enables to simulate a dynamic type of a system, for examble a system of foxes and rabbits population in accordance to each other or to draw a graph of a specific alternate current. Mostly anything, that can be described with a continuous mathematical function. In order to simulate a desired system, one must find out how the components affect each other and compose a scheme in the package accordingly. If the scheme is composed then the simulator will draw a graph of all the desired values with a designated step, thus simulating the system.
</p>
<p>Block descriptions
<ul>
  <li> Simulation engine - The required part of every simulation. This block must be present and
  set as super in order for the simulation to work. It requires total simulation time, and a step between two simulation points or the total amount of simulation points to be calculated in the simulation</li>
  <li> Clock - This block gives an output that can be used as a simulation variable (time). The clock will be the start of a scheme in most cases, and it will usually be connected to the x-axis of the drawing block.</li>
  <li> Adder - this block simply adds together two values. The input values can also be modified before adding via two extra ports. The input values will be multiplied with the values from those two ports.</li>
  <li> Inverter - inverter simply negates the value, effectively multiplying the output with -1</li>
  <li> Integrator - integrates the value it gets. This block works as a numerical integrator, as such, it works well for most simple simulation cases. It is possible to add constant to the integrators first value, by modifying its field "init" (short for initial value).</li>
  <li> </li>
  <li> Multiplier - it multiplies the two values in its "in" ports. It is also capable of giving a power of the value to the multiplication, via its two extra ports, similar to the adder.</li>
  <li> Cosine - this block returns the cosine of the input value.</li>
  <li> Multiseries Graph drawer - this block produces the output in a graphical form. It needs one output on its x axis and it can take any number of inputs on its y axis.</li>
</ul>
